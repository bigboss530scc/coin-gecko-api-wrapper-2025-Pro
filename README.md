## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here's a detailed description of how a `coin-gecko-api-wrapper` integrates with major cryptocurrency exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management, clarifying its role and the typical architecture of such a system.

### The Core Misconception: CoinGecko as a Data Provider, Not a Trader

First, it's crucial to understand that **CoinGecko does not execute trades**. A `coin-gecko-api-wrapper` is a library or piece of code that simplifies fetching data from the **CoinGecko API**. CoinGecko is a **data aggregator**, not a brokerage or exchange.

Therefore, the integration is not direct. Instead, CoinGecko and exchange APIs play complementary roles in a larger automated system.
